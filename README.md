## About

Agent-S.H.I.E.L.D is an AI governance platform designed to monitor and control autonomous AI agents in real time. As organizations begin deploying large numbers of AI agents that can access tools, APIs, and sensitive data, there is a growing need for systems that ensure these agents operate safely and within defined policies.

This project acts as an AI auditor for AI agents, analyzing every request an agent makes, evaluating risk, and enforcing security policies before actions are executed.

Key capabilities demonstrated in this demo include:

• Real-time monitoring of agent requests
• Risk scoring engine with severity classification
• Policy rule violation detection
• Dangerous command and sensitive data detection
• Automated decision engine (approve, flag, or kill switch)
• Agent permission management and control
• Complete audit trail and decision reasoning
• Dual audit views for technical and business users
• Real-time dashboard with WebSocket updates
• Security pipeline visualization showing the full decision path
• Violation tracking and agent status monitoring

The system also includes a multi-agent analysis pipeline that evaluates agent intent, detects potential policy violations, classifies severity, and proposes mitigation actions.

Agent-S.H.I.E.L.D is designed as a governance layer for AI agent ecosystems, helping organizations maintain security, transparency, and compliance as autonomous AI systems become more widely deployed.
